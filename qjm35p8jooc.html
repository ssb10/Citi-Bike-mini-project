The result of Moods Median test is as follows:</div><div></div><div>Conclusion:</div><div> Traffic is a common issue in cities.   The reason behind understanding citi bike usage is that it can be used to understand traffic patterns. May be analyzing trip duration during hour of the day can help in understanding the peak traffic hours and help in applying right measures to solve traffic issues. If average trip duration is more but number of trips in less then conclusions can be drawn about traffic.  </div><div>The tests have concluded that average trip duration for weekends is higher than weekdays. The citi bike usage cn be said to be more on weekends. But this is under the assumption that higher the trip duration higher the usage. There can be better way of analyzing this data by considering number of trips and trip duration both. Also considering data for more than one month can bring different results.</div><div>  </div>
