It is a non parametric test i.e. it does not make any assumption about the distribution of data at test.  </div><div> For the mini project I have used the&nbsp;<code>scipy.stats</code> package.

The citi bike usage cn be said to be more on weekends. But this is under the assumption that higher the trip duration higher the usage. There can be better way of analyzing this data by considering number of trips and trip duration both. Also considering data for more than one month can bring different results.</div><div> Traffic is a common issue in cities.   The reason behind understanding citi bike usage is that it can be used to understand traffic patterns. May be analyzing number of trips during hu</div>
