The reason behind understanding citi bike usage is that it can be used to understand traffic patterns. May be analyzing trip duration during hour of the day can help in understanding the peak traffic hours and help in applying right measures to solve traffic issues. If average trip duration is more but number of trips in less then conclusions can be drawn about traffic. </div>
