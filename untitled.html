<div><b>Abstract:&nbsp;</b>As a part of the citi bike mini project, I aim to look at the citi bike usage for weekdays and weekends. After completing the analysis and using statistical tests to verify my results, I have concluded that the citibike usage is more for weekends as compared to weekdays.</div><div></div><div><b>Introduction:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></div><div>Citi Bike is widely used in New York City. There is a lot of data collected for citi bikes. The data has many attributes, trip duration, start station, end station, type of users to mention a few. While there are many interesting trends that can be observed in this data, I have chosen to look at the average citi bike usage for weekdays and weekends. The usage will be gauged by using the trip duration parameter. I have assumed that trip duration is higher when the number of trips are more.The citi bike usage over weekdays and weekends can help to understand the traffic patterns. The trip duration total for weekdays or weekends will be more due to more number of users as well as the traffic.</div><div>Citi Bike data about is studied before for various purposes. I came across two papers where citi bike data is used for different analysis. One paper talks&nbsp; about the usage of citibikes on weekdays and weekends by hour of the day. the another study talks about usage in summer and winter months. These studies can be found in the links given in references below.There are interesting results observed in these studies. In the mini project, I am looking at usage of citi bike as wellbut with a little different perspective.Following are the details of data, methodology and tests used for the same.</div><div></div><div><b>Data Used:</b></div><div>Data used is citibike trip data for July 2017. A view of the data used for the analysis is shown in the figure below.</div><div></div>
